# 🛠 Cisco Config Backup & Restore via TFTP

This cheat sheet is a companion to my LinkedIn video on backing up Cisco device configurations using a TFTP server. It’s designed to help network engineers and students quickly recall the commands and setup steps needed to:

- Back up running or startup configurations to a TFTP server
- Restore configurations from TFTP back to a Cisco device
- Troubleshoot common TFTP-related issues
- Understand basic security considerations

TFTP is a lightweight and fast protocol, commonly used in lab and trusted network environments for configuration transfers. This guide walks you through practical, tested examples for real-world use.

> ⚠️ Note: TFTP lacks authentication and encryption — avoid using it in untrusted or production environments without additional security measures.


## 🖥 Sample Topology
Below is a simple network topology used to demonstrate the TFTP configuration backup process.

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before performing backup or restore operations, ensure the following requirements are met:

✅ **TFTP server is installed and running**
  - Examples: [TFTPD32](http://tftpd32.jounin.net/), SolarWinds TFTP (Windows), or `tftp-hpa` (Linux)
- ✅ **TFTP server is reachable** from the Cisco device via IP
- ✅ **Correct folder permissions** are set on the TFTP server's root directory
- ✅ **Firewall rules allow TFTP traffic**
  - **UDP Port 69** must be open
  - Source: Cisco device IP  
  - Destination: TFTP server IP

> 💡 Tip: Test connectivity with `ping <TFTP server IP>` from the Cisco device to verify reachability before initiating any transfer.

## 🔁 Backing Up Cisco Configuration to TFTP

### 1. Backing up Running Configuration
```bash
copy running-config tftp:
```
Prompts:
 - Address or name of remote host? → 192.168.1.100
 - Destination filename? → rtr1-running-config

### 2. Backing up Startup Configuration
```bash
copy startup-config tftp:
```

## 🔄 Restoring Configuration from TFTP
### 1. Restoring Running Configuration
```bash
copy tftp: running-config
```
Prompts:
 - Address or name of remote host? → 192.168.1.100
 - Source filename? → rtr1-running-config
